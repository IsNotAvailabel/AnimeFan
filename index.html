          "That day, the human race remembered the terror of being dominated by
          them, and the shame of being held captive in a birdcage..." â€” Over 100
          years ago, a natural predator of humanity appeared: the Titans, giant
          humanoid but mindless monsters whose sole purpose of existence seemed
          to be to devour humans. There was an insurmountable gap in power
          between them and mankind, and as a result, humanity was rapidly
          exterminated to the brink of extinction. The survivors responded by
          constructing three concentric walls: Wall Maria, Wall Rose and Wall
          Sina, which graced them with a century of peace. However, one day a
          Colossal Titan far larger than any other seen before breached the
          outer wall, allowing the smaller Titans to invade the human territory
          and forcing the survivors to retreat to the inner walls. Eren Jaeger,
          a boy whose mother was eaten during the invasion, vowed to wipe every
          last Titan off the face of the Earth, and joined the military
          determined to exact his revenge.
